- âœ… **Lightweight** - No development tools or editors included
- âœ… **Fast Startup** - Quick initialization for production environments
- âœ… **Stable API** - Production-ready interface

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

```bash
pip install tui-form-engine
```

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```python
from tui_form_engine import FlowEngine

# Initialize engine
engine = FlowEngine(flows_dir="flows")

# Execute a flow
result = engine.execute_flow("user_registration")
print(f"User: {result['name']}, Email: {result['email']}")
```

## ðŸ”§ Core Components

### FlowEngine
The main engine for loading and executing YAML flow definitions.

```python
from tui_form_engine import FlowEngine

engine = FlowEngine(
    flows_dir="flows",        # Directory containing YAML flows
    theme="default"           # UI theme: default, dark, minimal
)

# Execute with user interaction
result = engine.execute_flow("my_flow")

# Execute with mock responses (testing)
mock_responses = {"name": "John", "email": "john@example.com"}
result = engine.execute_flow("my_flow", mock_responses=mock_responses)
```

### QuestionaryUI
Enhanced UI components with themes and styling.

```python
from tui_form_engine import QuestionaryUI

ui = QuestionaryUI(theme="dark")
name = ui.prompt("Enter your name:")
confirmed = ui.confirm("Continue?")
choice = ui.select("Choose option:", ["A", "B", "C"])
```

## ðŸ“‹ Flow Definition Format

Create YAML files defining your interactive flows:

```yaml
layout_id: user_registration
title: User Registration
description: Collect user information
steps:
  - id: name
    type: text
    message: "Enter your name:"
    validate: required
    
  - id: email
    type: text
    message: "Enter your email:"
    validate: email
    
  - id: subscribe
    type: confirm
    message: "Subscribe to newsletter?"
    default: true

output_mapping:
  user:
    name: name
    email: email
    newsletter: subscribe
```
