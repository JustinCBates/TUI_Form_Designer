# Workflow Architecture Design Document

## üéØ Executive Summary

Based on real-world implementation experience with the WSL & Docker Desktop Manager, we have identified critical gaps in the current TUI Form Designer architecture that limit its effectiveness for complex user workflows. This document proposes a comprehensive workflow architecture to address these limitations.

## üîç Problem Analysis

### Current Architecture Limitations

#### 1. **Linear Flow Assumption**
- **Current**: Forms assume linear progression start ‚Üí end
- **Reality**: Users need to navigate back, skip sections, return to menus
- **Impact**: Poor UX, requires application restarts for corrections

#### 2. **Static Decision Making** 
- **Current**: Form choices are fixed at design time
- **Reality**: Options should change based on system state, user context
- **Impact**: Inappropriate choices offered, conflicts and errors

#### 3. **No Workflow State Management**
- **Current**: Each form execution is independent 
- **Reality**: Complex workflows need state persistence, recovery
- **Impact**: Lost progress, inability to resume interrupted workflows

#### 4. **Limited Branching Logic**
- **Current**: Basic field conditionals (show/hide fields)
- **Reality**: Need decision trees, parallel paths, contextual routing
- **Impact**: Overly complex single forms, poor separation of concerns

## üèóÔ∏è Proposed Solution: Workflow Definition Language

### Core Concepts

#### **Workflow Definition**
```yaml
workflow_id: "example_workflow"
version: "1.0"
description: "Example workflow demonstrating key concepts"

# Global workflow configuration
config:
  navigation:
    back_enabled: true
    breadcrumbs: true
    auto_save: true
  
  error_handling:
    retry_attempts: 3
    fallback_flow: "error_recovery"
  
  context_providers:
    - name: "system_state"
      module: "detection.py"
      function: "get_system_state"
      cache_ttl: 300  # 5 minutes

# Entry point for workflow execution
entry_point: "initialize"

# Node definitions
nodes:
  initialize:
    type: "context_provider"
    provider: "system_state"
    next: "system_decision"
    
  system_decision:
    type: "decision"
    condition: "context.system_state.status"
    branches:
      "clean": "fresh_install"
      "configured": "maintenance_menu" 
      "partial": "repair_wizard"
    default: "unknown_state_handler"
    
  fresh_install:
    type: "form_sequence"
    forms: ["requirements_check", "basic_config", "advanced_options"]
    navigation:
      back_to: "system_decision"
      skip_allowed: ["advanced_options"]
    completion: "install_execution"
    
  maintenance_menu:
    type: "form"
    layout: "maintenance_menu.yml"
    dynamic_choices:
      field: "action_selection"  
      provider: "get_available_actions"
      depends_on: ["context.system_state"]
    routes:
      "Update Configuration": "config_update_flow"
      "Status Check": "status_display"
      "Uninstall": "uninstall_confirmation"
      "‚Üê Exit": "workflow_complete"

  config_update_flow:
    type: "conditional_form"
    base_layout: "configuration.yml"
    field_modifications:
      - field: "memory_allocation"
        condition: "context.system_state.memory < 8GB"
        action: "set_max_value"
        value: 4
    navigation:
      back_to: "maintenance_menu"
    validation:
      - provider: "validate_config_change"
        blocking: true
    completion: "apply_changes"

# Reusable components
components:
  confirmation_pattern:
    type: "form"
    layout: "generic_confirmation.yml"
    context_injection:
      - field: "action_description"
        source: "workflow.current_action"
      - field: "risk_level" 
        source: "context.risk_assessment"

# Workflow completion handlers
completion_handlers:
  install_execution:
    type: "external_command"
    command: "python installer.py"
    parameters:
      - source: "workflow.collected_config"
        format: "json_file"
    success: "installation_complete"
    failure: "installation_error"
    
  workflow_complete:
    type: "summary_display"
    template: "completion_summary.txt"
    context: "workflow.all_results"
```

### Key Features

#### **1. Context Providers**
Dynamic data injection into workflows:
```python
@workflow_context_provider
def get_system_state():
    return {
        "docker_installed": detect_docker(),
        "wsl_version": detect_wsl(),
        "available_memory": get_system_memory(),
        "recommended_config": calculate_recommendations()
    }
```

#### **2. Decision Nodes**
Complex branching logic:
```yaml
decision_node:
  type: "decision"
  condition: "context.user_role == 'admin' and context.system_state == 'production'"
  branches:
    true: "admin_production_flow"
    false: "standard_user_flow"
  evaluation: "runtime"  # or "design_time"
```

#### **3. Navigation Management**
Built-in navigation with state preservation:
```yaml
navigation:
  back_enabled: true
  breadcrumbs: ["Home", "Configuration", "Memory Settings"]
  cancel_points: ["main_menu", "confirmation_step"]
  auto_save_intervals: "per_step"  # or "per_form", "manual"
```

#### **4. Dynamic Form Modification**
Runtime form customization:
```yaml
dynamic_form:
  base_layout: "server_config.yml"
  modifications:
    - condition: "context.deployment_type == 'docker'"
      changes:
        - add_field: "container_memory_limit"
        - hide_field: "bare_metal_options"
        - modify_choices: 
            field: "storage_type"
            add: ["docker_volumes", "bind_mounts"]
```

    # Test decision logic
    test_context = {"system_state": "clean"}
    next_node = workflow.evaluate_decision("system_check", test_context)
    assert next_node == "fresh_install_flow"
    
    # Test navigation paths
    nav_graph = workflow.build_navigation_graph()
    assert nav_graph.can_reach("config_step", "main_menu") == True
```

### **Integration Testing**
```python 
def test_complete_workflow():
    # Mock context providers
    with mock.patch('system_detection.get_state') as mock_detect:
        mock_detect.return_value = {"status": "configured"}
        
        # Execute workflow with mocked context
        workflow = WorkflowEngine("installer.yml")
        results = workflow.execute_with_mock_inputs([
            "maintenance_menu",
            "Update Configuration", 
            "Apply Changes"
        ])
        
        assert results.completed_successfully == True
        assert "config_updated" in results.actions_taken
```
