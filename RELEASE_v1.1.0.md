# Release Notes: TUI Form Designer v1.1.0

**Release Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Type:** Critical Safety Fix  
**Breaking Changes:** None  
**Backward Compatibility:** 100% - Drop-in replacement for v1.0.x

---

## üö® Critical Issue Resolved

This release resolves a **critical production blocker** where users were trapped in infinite loops unable to exit applications that use the TUI Form Designer.

### The Problem

When users pressed **Ctrl+C** during interactive prompts:
- The `questionary` library sometimes swallowed the `KeyboardInterrupt` signal
- Instead of raising an exception, it returned `None`
- Consumer applications expecting exceptions for cancellation never received them
- This created **infinite loops** where pressing Ctrl+C did nothing

### Real-World Impact

**WSL & Docker Desktop Manager** - Users discovered they couldn't exit menu systems. Pressing Ctrl+C would print a cancellation message but immediately re-prompt, creating an inescapable loop.

---

## ‚úÖ What's Fixed in v1.1.0

### 1. None-Return Detection
Added explicit check for `None` returns from `question.ask()`:

```python
answer = question.ask()
if answer is None:
    questionary.print("\n‚ùå Flow execution cancelled by user.", style="bold red")
    raise FlowExecutionError("Flow execution cancelled by user")
```

**Impact:** Swallowed Ctrl+C signals are now properly detected and converted to exceptions.

### 2. Emergency Exit Mechanism
Added double Ctrl+C handler for force-quit scenarios:

- **First Ctrl+C:** Raises `FlowExecutionError` with warning message
- **Second Ctrl+C (within 2 seconds):** Force exits with `sys.exit(130)`

```python
def _emergency_exit_handler(self, signum, frame):
    if self._exit_requested:
        questionary.print("\nüö® EMERGENCY EXIT - Force quitting...", style="bold red")
        sys.exit(130)
    else:
        self._exit_requested = True
        questionary.print(
            "\n‚ö†Ô∏è  Exit requested. Press Ctrl+C again within 2 seconds to force quit.",
            style="bold yellow"
        )
        raise KeyboardInterrupt()
```

**Impact:** Users can always exit, even if the flow has bugs or hangs.

### 3. Proper Signal Handler Management
Flow execution now installs and properly restores signal handlers:

```python
def execute_flow(self, flow_id, context=None, mock_responses=None):
    # Install emergency exit handler
    self._exit_requested = False
    self._original_sigint_handler = signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, self._emergency_exit_handler)
    
    try:
        return self._execute_flow_internal(flow_id, context, mock_responses)
    finally:
        # Restore original signal handler
        if self._original_sigint_handler is not None:
            signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, self._original_sigint_handler)
```

**Impact:** Signal handling is clean and predictable across nested flow executions.

### 4. Comprehensive Test Coverage
Added dedicated signal handling test suite:

**File:** `tests/test_signal_handling.py`

- `test_execute_flow_treats_none_as_cancellation` - Verifies None returns raise FlowExecutionError
- `test_execute_flow_keyboardinterrupt_raises` - Verifies KeyboardInterrupt is properly caught

**Test Results:** ‚úÖ 2/2 passing

## üì¶ Upgrade Guide

### Installing

```bash
pip install --upgrade tui-form-designer
```

Or in `requirements.txt`:
```
tui-form-designer==1.1.0
```

### Compatibility

**100% backward compatible** - This is a drop-in replacement for v1.0.x:
- All existing APIs unchanged
- All existing flows work identically
- No code changes required in consumer applications

### What You Get

After upgrading, your applications will automatically benefit from:
- ‚úÖ Users can cleanly exit with Ctrl+C
- ‚úÖ No more infinite loops in interactive applications
- ‚úÖ Emergency exit mechanism (double Ctrl+C) as safety net
- ‚úÖ Predictable signal handling behavior

## üéØ Use Cases Now Supported

### WSL & Docker Desktop Manager
```python
while True:
    try:
        results = engine.execute_flow("main_menu")
        choice = results.get('operation')
        
        if choice == 'exit':
            break
            
        # Handle operation
    except FlowExecutionError:
        print("User cancelled. Exiting...")
        break  # ‚úÖ NOW WORKS!
```

### Interactive Menu Systems
Users can now reliably exit menu loops with Ctrl+C.

### Configuration Wizards
Setup wizards properly handle user cancellation without leaving systems in inconsistent states.

### Nested Flow Scenarios
Signal handlers are properly managed across nested flow executions.
